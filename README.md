To develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation, you can focus on basic operations such as swapping pixel values or applying a mathematical operation to each pixel. This approach will give you a good understanding of image encryption techniques. Below is a Python script that uses the Pillow library for image processing and NumPy for handling pixel values. This script demonstrates a basic encryption and decryption technique using pixel swapping and arithmetic operations.
